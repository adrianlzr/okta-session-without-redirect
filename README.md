# okta-session-without-redirect
Create a Okta session without performing a browser redirect.


In order to use this sample, make sure you set the baseUrl variable from session.js to your own Okta domain. 

This should be treated as is. Okta does not offer any liability / support for this flow. This sample should be used as a POC and can be copied / cloned and used as needed.
